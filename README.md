# PBI_Healthcare_patient_wait_list_analysis
In this project, I analyzed healthcare data for three different patient groups to see how the waitlist varies between medical specialties, patient types, and age groups.
My goal for this project is to analyze the given Healthcare data and provide information and insights regarding the waitlists so that they can better manage their hospital.
## Required Information
1.Tracking the current status of patient waitlists.\
2.Analyzing the historical monthly trend of waiting lists in Inpatient and Outpatient categories.\
3.Providing detailed specialty-level and age profile analysis.\
4.Determining the average and median waitlist.\
5.Determining the current total waitlist.

Insights from the Dashboard:
1. Overall Patient Wait List Analysis:

    Current Wait List: The latest month's wait list is 709K, showing an increase compared to the previous year's 640K.
        This suggests a growth of 69K patients on the wait list, indicating possible system strain or delays in addressing patient needs.

2. Case Type Distribution:

    Outpatient Cases dominate with 72.49% of total cases.
    Day Cases account for 16.89%, while Inpatient Cases represent only 10.62%.
        This reflects a significant reliance on outpatient services compared to other case types.

3. Key Indicators – Patient Wait List by Time Band and Age Profile:

    Longest Wait Times (18+ months):
        16-64 age group has the highest number (136 patients).
        The 65+ group also shows significant wait times (66 patients).
    Shorter Wait Times (0-3 months):
        A balanced distribution across all age groups, with slightly higher representation for the 16-64 group.

4. Top Specialties:

    Pediatric Dermatology leads with 168 cases.
    Other top specialties include:
        Pediatric ENT: 148 cases
        Pediatric Orthopedics: 115 cases
        Accident & Emergency: 111 cases
        Pediatric Cardiology: 102 cases
        Focused attention is needed for pediatric care and emergencies, as they are the highest contributors to the wait list.

5. Monthly Trend Analysis – Case Type Comparison:

    Day Cases vs. Inpatient Cases:
        Day Cases have fluctuated but have remained steady at around 20-25K cases.
        Inpatient cases also hover around 20-23K cases, showing consistency without major spikes.

    Outpatient Case Trend:
        A steady increase in outpatient numbers from 2018 to 2021, with a peak of 630K cases in recent months.
        This trend highlights growing demand for outpatient services.

## Recommendations:
  ### 1.Address Long Waiting Times:
   Focus on patients in the 16-64 and 65+ age groups, especially those waiting over 18 months.
   Explore operational improvements to reduce wait times for these age groups.

  ### 2.Specialty-Specific Action:
  Allocate more resources to high-demand specialties such as Pediatric Dermatology and Pediatric ENT.
  Investigate causes for delays in these areas and optimize scheduling.

  ### 3.Outpatient Services Expansion:
  Since outpatient cases dominate the waitlist and are growing, additional outpatient facilities and staff should be prioritized.
